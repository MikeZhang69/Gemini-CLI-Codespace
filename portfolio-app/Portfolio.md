- Custom benchmark creation (factor-tilted, smart-beta)  
- Integrate OpenAPI/Swagger for API docs and developer portal  
- Implement single-sign-on (SSO) for enterprise clients  
- Add machine-learning recommendations (auto-allocation, tax-loss harvesting)  
- Multi-tenant architecture for financial advisors  
- GDPR, CCPA compliance, SOC 2 security certification  
- Extensible plugin system for new asset classes or data sources
